<p>For the recreation of the classic Zelda dungeon, I worked on implementing the collectable power-ups, 
  implementing the invincibility mode, implementing the player's health and ability to take damage, 
  implementing the bomb weapon, and many of the enemies (including Stalfos, Keese, BladeTrap, Wallmaster, and Aquamentus).
