<a href="p1_gold_builds.zip"> Recreation of Level 1 from The Legend of Zelda, with bonus custom level </a>
</ul>

<p>For the recreation of the classic Zelda dungeon, I worked on implementing the collectable power-ups, 
  implementing the invincibility mode, implementing the player's health and ability to take damage, 
  implementing the bomb weapon, and many of the enemies (including Stalfos, Keese, BladeTrap, Wallmaster, and Aquamentus).

  For the custom level, I worked on implementing the bat weapon, as well as the Aquamentus-themed rooms in the dungeon.
